# JavaOnlineShop

Java project taken from Udemy Course by LearnIT University to create the backend for an online shop. Sign up, sign in, and sign out are stubbed, as the basis of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of basic OOP concepts such as inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation, componentization, and more. I built this without consulting any supporting documetation, and have added additional functionality to the existing template to expand my knowledge even more. When using the backend, no errors
will be thrown, and instead, the command line will only accept valid input for the current component. The online shop has the aforementioned sign up, in, and out, as well as a Product Catalog page, Checkout page, My Orders page, Settings page (to change email and password), 
and Customer List page, where all individuals using the system are tracked.
